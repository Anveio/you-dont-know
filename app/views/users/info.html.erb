    <h3>First, a little about us. </h3>
      <p> We're a 3/10 Mythic Nighthold late-night raiding guild on Horde-side Thrall. We have a strong core group but we're always looking for new faces to keep it competitive. Our goal is to down each tier of content before the release of the next one without pulling extra nights or extra hours and maintaining a casual and calm atmosphere. This site is mainly to process your applications -- the real fun happens on Discord.</p>
    <h3>Raid Times & Loot</h3>
      <p>Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday 11PM - 2AM, Server Time (EST).</p>
      <p> Loot is distributed via Loot Council to best benefit progression. You must inform an officer about which tier pieces you plan on using to be eligible for loot from Nighthold.</p>
    <h3>Recruitment</h3>
      <p>We are recruiting exceptional players of any class. But if you're a Warlock, Holy Paladin, Disc Priest, Resto Shaman, Mistweaver Monk, feel especially encouraged to apply.</p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>You'll need some sort of logs so we can evaluate you. Go to <a href=https://www.warcraftlogs.com/>warcraftlogs.com</a> and search your for character to find yours. </p>
      <p>Required Add-ons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href=https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/rclootcouncil>RC Loot Council</a>, unless you're a selfless soul that never wants loot.</li>
          <li><a href=https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2>Weak Auras</a>, some Weak Auras make fights so much easier.</li>
          <li><a href=https://mods.curse.com/addons/WOW/EXORSUS-RAID-TOOLS>Exorsus Raid tools</a>, mostly just for the note function.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Applying (It's simple, promise)</h3>
      <p>The first step is just to fill out the short application on this website -- it's just a few questions.
      After that we'll contact you in game to schedule an interview on our Discord.</p>
    <h3>Trialing</h3>
      <p>The Trial period typically lasts 2 weeks (or 6 raid nights). Trials have last priority on loot (sorry!)</p>
