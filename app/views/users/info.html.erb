    <h3>First, a little about us. </h3>
      <p> We're a 7/7M & 2/3M Horde side guild on Thrall. We have a strong core group but we're always looking for new faces to keep it competitive. This site is mainly to process your applications -- the real fun happens on Discord.</p>
    <h3>Raid Times & Loot</h3>
      <p>Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday 11PM - 2AM, Server Time (EST).</p>
      <p> Loot is distributed via Loot Council to best benefit progression. You must inform an officer about which tier pieces you plan on using to be eligible for loot from Nighthold.</p>
    <h3>Recruitment</h3>
      <p>We are recruiting exceptional players of any class. But if you're a Warlock, Holy Paladin, Disc Priest, Resto Shaman, Mistweaver Monk, feel especially encouraged to apply.</p>
    <h3>Applying (It's simple, promise)</h3>
      <p>The first step is just to fill out the short application on this website -- it's just a few questions.
      After that we'll contact you in game to schedule an interview on our Discord.</p>
    <h3>Trialing</h3>
      <p>The Trial period typically lasts 2 weeks (or 6 raid nights). Trials have last priority on loot (sorry!)</p>
